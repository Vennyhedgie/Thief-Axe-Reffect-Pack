# Thief-Axe-Reffect-Pack
A more visible UI element for Thief Axe's Weapon Mechanic

Tracks the number of active axes. Also, if at max stacks, the axe icon will light up. You may disable this if you like.

# How to use
First, download the zip file to your reffect root folder like so:

Then right click > Extract here (the necessary files will be added to the packs and icons subfolders).

Then, return to reffect ingame and refresh packs.

Finally, enable / disable your interface size of choice:

If you don't want to have the full stack axe, you can disable the element:

# Note

If you use the Thief Spear reffect pack, they will overlap, and you will have to move one of them out of the way. Since thief generally doesn't use two weapons actively due to how initiative works, it's up to you to choose which pack to use:
